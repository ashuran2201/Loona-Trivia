        <p className="idalso-text">
            LOONAVERSE is a fictional universe where the member of LOONA live in. it is depicted through their music
            videos and teasers. Its existense was officially announced on April 26 2017, but was given its name on may
            22 of the same year. <br /><br />

            Since the lore of the LOONAVERSE can be interpreted in many different ways, many Orbits have begun to
            theorize what the music videos entail, and how each member's story intertwines with each other. This part of
            the article covers the biggest and most popular theories on the LOONA music videos and the timeline of
            events in the LOONAVERSE.<br /><br />

            The LOONAVERSE is a universe that exists on a möbius strip. The members of LOONA 1/3 reside on earth and
            portray realistic girls that can be found on streets or at schools. ODD EYE CIRCLE lives between earth and
            space, aka the middle earth. They display changing and mutative characteristics while suggesting love should
            be taken control of instead of being passive. Lastly, yyxy inhabit a 'utopia', known as 'Edenism', beyond
            earth and the middle earth. They decide to escape their 'Eden' in order to discover themselves.

            There is no official timeline of the LOONAVERSE that Blockberry Creative has confirmed, but instead we are
            given clues through member reveals, music videos, and teasers about the sequence of events in this world.
            Many different people have begun to theorize what events in the LOONAVERSE impacted what, and how every bit
            of lore fits together.<br /><br />
            By far the most popular timeline is according to the order in which music videos and members were revealed.
            ("There are no simultaneous happenings. Aside from the two Carols, everything is happening like a domino
            effect. When one thing happens it triggers another addition to the LOONAVERSE.")
